# My Shopping List

Today I need to go to the grocery store.
What shall I buy? Hmm. This question is tough.
Well, if I go the fridge, I can find out what I have.
If I find out what I have, I can find out what I do not have.
If I find out what I do not have, I can find out what I need!
This is awesome!
